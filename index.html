                    As the first rays of sunlight bathe the shimmering waters of the Pearl River Estuary, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area celebrates its fifth anniversary. Hong Kong, Macao, and the nine cities of the Pearl River Delta have increasingly fused into a harmonious Bay Area, revealing its profound essence and vast potential. Over the past five years, the Greater Bay Area, occupying less than<span class="highlight-data">1%</span> of the country’s land area and home to just <span class="highlight-data">6%</span> of its population, has generated <span class="highlight-data">11%</span> of the nation's GDP, demonstrating boundless vitality and potential.

                <p class="introduction-paragraph">
                    Since 2018, the total economy of the Greater Bay Area has grown from <span class="highlight-data">10.8 trillion</span> yuan to over <span class="highlight-data">14 trillion</span> yuan in 2023, demonstrating a robust growth momentum. This growth is equivalent to having "created a new Shenzhen." Over these five years, the total import and export volume of the nine mainland cities has approached <span class="highlight-data">40 trillion</span> yuan, further underscoring the Greater Bay Area's significant position in the global economy.

                    The wheels of history roll forward relentlessly. Though five years may seem brief, they are more than enough to witness the transformation and rise of a region. Today, five years later, it is necessary for us to revisit why the cities of the Greater Bay Area have come together and to reflect on the achievements of the region. Why have these cities converged? It is due to the deep historical connections between them, as well as the present-day opportunities they share. And what has the Greater Bay Area achieved? Over these five years, it has answered this question with dazzling data and compelling stories.

                <p>Over the past five years, Hong Kong, Macao, and the nine cities of the Pearl River Delta have moved towards deep integration in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. However, in fact, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Pearl River Delta Bay Area already presented itself to the world as a unified urban landscape. Cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Macao, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, and Jiangmen once together formed a magnificent city — the Guangzhou Prefecture.</p>

                <p>During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Guangzhou Prefecture was renowned for its unique economic position. The Gazetteer of Guangzhou Prefecture describes its prosperity with the words: "The rivers and mountains are clear and bright, and the brilliance of its culture shines. The capital city is flourishing, with abundant resources." Its economic policies were equally distinctive. The Gazetteer of Guangzhou Prefecture even has a dedicated section on the salt administration, documenting the trade of sea salt in Guangzhou, which reflects the special economic status of Guangzhou Prefecture during that era.</p>

                        With the accelerated development of infrastructure in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, regional transportation connectivity has greatly improved, gradually reducing physical distances. Since 2018, the railway network in Guangdong Province has expanded from <span class="highlight-data">28</span> lines to <span class="highlight-data">41</span>, with total mileage increasing from <span class="highlight-data">885</span> kilometers to <span class="highlight-data">1,383</span> kilometers.

                    <h4>Shorter Distances for Ecology</h4>
                    <p class="introduction-paragraph">
                        The rapid development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has significantly strengthened environmental collaboration, continuously shrinking the ecological distance between regions. Green infrastructure has become a cornerstone of progress, with energy-efficient buildings and green transportation networks driving advancements in regional sustainability.
                    </p>

                    <p class="introduction-paragraph">
                        For example, cities like Zhuhai and Shenzhen have actively promoted the construction of green buildings and energy systems, while Guangzhou has seen a steady rise in its green mobility index. Cross-border environmental governance has also been enhanced, with pollution control projects in the Pearl River water system transcending administrative boundaries between Guangdong Province and Macao. Local governments and enterprises have collaborated on transboundary initiatives to address water pollution.
                    </p>

                        In 2023, data from the Pearl River Delta Regional Air Monitoring Network showed significant reductions in air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, PM10, and PM2.5. Annual average concentrations of these pollutants dropped by up to <span class="highlight-data">86%</span> compared to historical peaks. Meanwhile, the Greater Bay Area has made notable progress in green energy adoption, with clean energy now accounting for over <span class="highlight-data">30%</span> of total energy consumption in 2023. These efforts have not only improved regional ecological quality but also laid a strong foundation for harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.

                        <p class="introduction-paragraph">
                            In the field of education, a vibrant landscape of shared resources and collaborative talent cultivation is unfolding across the Greater Bay Area. In higher education, institutions such as Hong Kong and Macao’s leading universities have pioneered the establishment of branch campuses or joint ventures in the region, while mainland universities like Shenzhen University and Sun Yat-sen University have extended their research institutes to Hong Kong and Macao. Beyond higher education, cooperation in basic education is deepening. The availability of high-quality educational resources in cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen has attracted a growing number of students from Hong Kong and Macao. In 2023 alone, over <span class="highlight-data">80,000</span> Hong Kong and Macao students were enrolled in primary and secondary schools in Guangdong.

                            In healthcare and social security, cross-border integration has provided residents with more comprehensive safeguards. Over <span class="highlight-data">300,000</span> residents from Hong Kong and Macao have enrolled in Guangdong’s social insurance programs—including old-age, unemployment, and work-related injury insurance—enjoying equal access to healthcare and welfare benefits as mainland residents. Cross-border medical insurance collaboration has also expanded, with Guangdong’s hospitals and those in Hong Kong and Macao improving reimbursement rates and coverage for residents seeking medical care on the mainland.
                        </p>

                        <p class="introduction-paragraph">
                            Additionally, the Greater Bay Area has introduced policies to enhance elderly care for cross-border residents.

                            In the realm of food security, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area’s "Basket Program"（"菜篮子"工程）has provided residents with greater access to safe, high-quality, and eco-friendly food. Under the 2019 "Implementation Plan for the Construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area 'Basket'"（《粤港澳大湾区“菜篮子”建设实施方案》） released by Guangzhou, the city has certified <span class="highlight-data">2,422</span> "Basket" production bases nationwide. These bases cover a wide range of agricultural products, including vegetables, fruits, meat, and aquatic products, ensuring a steady supply of fresh, premium ingredients for Bay Area residents.

            <p class="introduction-paragraph">
                As the stars of the night fade into dawn, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has traversed five years under the golden light of morning. For this vibrant land, five years are both a testament to time and a microcosm of progress. Every city, every street, and every laborer here has witnessed this grand transformation.
            </p>

            <p class="introduction-paragraph">
                The wheels of history roll forward, and in the boundless river of time, five years may seem but a fleeting moment. Yet at this milestone juncture, we must reflect on why we came together, what we have achieved, and then rally anew. On this new historical starting point, the Greater Bay Area will continue to deepen reform and opening-up, strengthen regional collaboration, and advance innovation-driven development, contributing its strength to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese Dream.
            </p>

            <p class="introduction-paragraph">
                We have every reason to believe that the future of the Greater Bay Area will shine even brighter, becoming a global exemplar of world-class urban clusters. Just as the Pearl River Estuary glistens in the dawn, it heralds a future brimming with hope.
